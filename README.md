## Problem Statement

Due to the pandemic and social distancing measures, we now live our lives virutally. People are working from home, attending classes online and interacting with loved ones through a screen. Now more than ever, keeping an schedule is important to our productivity and well-being. But it can be challenging to schedule many sections of our lives while never stepping foot inside a classroom or office. It's easy to become overwhelmed and stressed when the calendar on our wall is packed with events. And just the act of scrolling through a list of tasks on a smartphone can be tiring and demotivating. How can we organize our schedule while being able to easily keep track of the different parts of our lives?
