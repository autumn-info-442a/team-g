## Problem Statement

Due to the pandemic and social distancing measures, we now live our lives virtually. For some this may seem like a dream come true, but for many families this is a big problem. Depending on a family's financial situation, they might have computers for each family member or just one computer for everyone in the household. Now more than ever, keeping a schedule is important to people's productivity and well-being. But in an environment with one computer per family, it will be challenging for a person to access their calendar and view it whenever they need to. How can family members maintain their personal schedule and view it whenever necessary?
